# Cheese Bread Standard Repo

Hi, this is the package repository for Cheese Bread

You can use the example.json provided in the files to see how to make one

If you wish to create a repository, all you need to do is make a new git repo and add the jsons you want and change Cheese Bread's lua to read it instead of this repo

A option to do it from Cheese Bread will be added in the future
